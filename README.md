# Strapsheet

This will be a website where users could compare tech product and we would be redirecting them to amazon , flipkart and other sites to buy them and i want to make this site the best site for tech comparision.


## Current plan
- We would be have a next js app and we will be trying to keep everything in this single repo.

- We would be writing a scrapper that would be crawling throught the web for new technologies and adding them to our website then accroding to there popularity and ranking we could show them to the user.

- Users would be able to see the pictures and compare the prices of the items they are looking for. We would not be selling anything (for now);

- Let's see what happens and where could we reach from this.
